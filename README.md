<h1>Findings/Conclusion</h1>
The overall finding is twofold. 
<br>
First that there are three aspects of company's operations that determine customer happiness/unhappiness. They are 
<ol>
  <li>X1=My order was delivered on time</li>
  <li>X5=I was satisfied with my courier</li>
  <li>X6=The app makes ordering easy</li>
</ol>
It's not about getting one of them right but instead if the company wants happy customers they need to get all 3 of them right i.e. get high responses on all 3. 
<br>
<br>
Secondly, the current problem in their operations explaining why 50% of customers are unhappy is (mostly) X5= I was satisified with my courier. 
<br>
This is what needs to be fixed in addition to improving X1 and X6 to avoid any 3/5 responses on those 2 questions.
